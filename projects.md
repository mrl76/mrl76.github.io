These are projects that I have worked on along with links to the the GitHub repositories

**Octocat's Adventure:**
Octocat's Adventure was created for the 2018 Steelhacks competion. I worked on a team where we participated in an open ended competition to create a new application. We chose to learn the Unity framework to create a simple game.

This project was used to show us the software development process. We stred with creating a software requirements specification document to plan out our work. Whe then used the Agile process to practice creating software in sprints. We also created a series of unit tests using JUnit.

**NetApp Capstone:**
For my capstone project me and three other computer science students were paired with a development team at NetApp to develop a new application using the FUSE framework. The main goals of this project were to implement additional functionality to the linux file system to track how much space each user is using in the file system and to enforce a per user space limit based on the space that was tracked. Additionally we created a series of python scripts to test our code that we were able to integrate into the makefile so that everytime that the program was compiled we could see which tests passed and which failed.
